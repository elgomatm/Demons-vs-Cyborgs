# Demons-vs-Cyborgs

My project's code structure was designed with an abundance of header and cpp files. Each of the classes, including Creature, Demon, Cyberdemon, Elf, Human, and Balrog, were assigned individual header files where constructors and member functions were initialized. Subsequently, I proceeded to define these constructors and functions in separate cpp files. The main function utilized these classes to generate objects such as Elf, Human, Cyberdemon, and Balrog, and implemented a for-loop to generate five unique results from the getDamage function.
